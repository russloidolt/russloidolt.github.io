<h2>
From the 'Job Description' for this posting:
</h2>
<h5>
"Enterprise HRIS is responsible for the strategy, implementation and end user support for TWDC enterprise systems for Human Resources."
</h5>
<p>

I have years of experience in HRIS, timekeeping and payroll software setup and integration.  Being part of a service organization, I am very experienced in evaluating and analyzing and supporting end users of software.
This statement of the expectations for this role could be used on my CV as a summary line for one of my top responsibilities in my current role.
</p>
<h2>
From the Responsibilities section for this posting:
</h2>
<h5>
"Analysis of existing HR system (SAP), working with the major stakeholders...to determine functional requirements, integration challenges."
</h5>
<p>
Again, this statement describes what I do and at what I am relied upon to succeed.  I am the technical expert in my organization who provides direction and recommendations to my coworkers and to clients.  I have been through many upgrades of software platforms and migration efforts from one platform to another in my career, and I am the person responsible for understanding functionality and integration challenges.  I am experienced and capable at delivering a thorough assessment and updates throughout this project.
I interact daily and communicate to stakeholders whether it is an executive or a direct report.  Regarding my direct experience with SAP, I have extensive experience with software platforms from the server side to the end user.  I will be able to quickly come up to speed on Employee Central and be the expert relied upon for insight.  My career has been characterized by this very situation multiple times (me being the person responsible for deep understanding of a platform in a short time frame).
</p>
<h5>
  "Work with technical counterparts to transform functional requirements into technical specifications."
</h5>
<p>
  Collaboration is how I roll.  I have led my coworkers in the transition to software tools that facilitate collaboration (e.g. basecamp.com and slack).  I have been responsible for leveraging and managing vendor relationships to accomplish project goals.  I model to others the discipline of documenting specification and reference instructions.  I will be able to work with other technical personnel to successfully assess and record functional requirements.
</p>
<h5>
  "Perform Employee Central configuration to meet stakeholder requirements"
</h5>
<p>
  My responsibilities have included DBA duties and platform configuration as well as client specific account configuration.  I am certain that Employee Central will have varying configuration requirements depending on the particular segment of Disney.  I have both the mental capacity and software experience to be successful in configuration of Employee Central and delivering to stakeholders per their needs.
</p>

<h2>
More from the posting:
</h2>
<h5>
"Manage small to medium scale workstreams/projects within overall Employee Central project, including development of project plans, identification of skills required for the team, leading those who do not directly report to the role (leading by influencing), inspiring collaboration and team work."
</h5>
<p>
I would point to the individual clients that I have had hundreds of projects to manage in the past.  I also have managed much larger scale efforts.  I have used tools and reporting considering the personnel involved (the technical level of participants) to provide effective project status updates and to assign tasks.  I have been successful time and time again in facilitating teamwork and successful outcomes.  The times that I have misstepped or have failed in project deliverables, I have addressed those errors to recover and have led the review to learn from the mistakes.
</p>
<h5>
"Minimum 5-7 years experience in Human Resources Information Systems with strong background in HR, payroll, security and reporting."
</h5>
<p>
I have more than the minimum experience in HR, payroll, security and reporting.  My current role includes supporting network infrastructure and security of systems.  I have been the go to person for SQL reporting and the technical expert on software use and configuration.  I am very capable in supporting these needs.
</p>
<h5>
"Ability to build strong relationships with clients, IT partners and co-workers."
</h5>
<p>
I have good character, and I am a man of integrity.  I start with this foundation because it is so important to strong working relationships.  I am a go getter and team player which will translate to me reliably and consistently working well with others.  I believe that my pixie dust will shine most in this area of how I work well with others even when it is difficult.  I have had times where working with teammates has not been easy, but I do take the high road.  I do pursue the task's goals as the top priority to minimize any challanges interacting with others, and I humble myself and seek reconciliation whenever I am aware of frustration or even hurt feelings.
</p>
<h5>
"Proven experience in process improvement"
</h5>
<p>
Software and technology brings change along with improved efficiency.  The learning required in me and others is significant and often overwhelming when process improvement happens.  I am aware of the increased need for communication and patience in order to successfully facilitate process improvement.  It is my experience in leading the analysis stage and process improvement efforts over many instances that provides me with this perspective.  I look forward to having the opportunity to contribute to process improvement at Disney!
