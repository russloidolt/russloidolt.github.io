<h2>
Highlights from Engineering Prog/Proj Lead MM (648048) primary duties:
</h2>
<h5>
"Plans and directs engineering and technical projects for internal and external customers, coordinating as required with work performed in other internal and external organizations.
Defines system and subsystem requirements, project scope, schedules, cost estimates, and deliverables that support mission objectives."
</h5>
<p>
The technical and engineering considerations of projects this position involves is certainly understated even considering the repetition of project management duties in this posting.  I admit I cannot imagine the extent of this role nor do I suggest I am completely prepared to step in and support all aspects in the beginning days.  However, I do commit to my character, my past performance and my potential.  I am a man defined by intelligence, hard work and integrity.  This foundation will be a factor in my learning and performance ongoing.  Although my previous project management efforts may not measure up to the standards necessary for SNL projects I have employed an engineering mindset and project management principles in each project I have managed.  I do commit to quickly adjusting to the necessary standards and tools.  It is my potential that still has a long runway that I am confident will help me in making adjustments.  I am committed to ongoing learning, and I have the mental bandwidth to be able to come up to speed quickly.
</p>
<h5>
"Uses engineering or technical judgment built upon a strong engineering or technical background to lead technical teams, identify potential project risks, develop risk mitigation strategies and corrective actions, and recommend risk acceptance or avoidance for all aspects of the project."
</h5>
<p>
I have a good mixture of engineering, business and customer service education and experience.  I mention this mixture because "judgement" and "lead technical teams" and "develop risk mitigation strategies" all require insight and foresight which are dependent upon depth of experience and breadth of experience.  I do not know it all, but I certainly have the mindset for and experience in contributing to the success of projects and minimizing poor outcomes.
</p>
<h5>
"Develops and delivers progress reports, proposals, requirements documentation, and presentations."
</h5>
<p>
In a business to business service industry, I have been involved many times in delivering proposals, communicating status updates and presenting to stakeholders and even audiences.  I enjoy crafting messages that are effective in communicating.  I also enjoy public speaking...it has been a rocky road at times, but I like to prepare presentations, practicing and speaking in front of people.

Knowledge, Skills & Abilities section:

<h5>
"Ability to effectively prioritize and execute tasks in a high-pressure environment."
</h5>
<p>
Payroll really is not "life or death" but can seem like it at times, especially for the employees of businesses being paid.  Regardless of the validity of the perception, the pressure to meet constant deadlines and to accurately deal with transactions that combine to total millions of dollars is real.  I am part of the executive team at Payday and am ultimately responsible for and have been involved often with delivering on time sensitive transactions that have very large dollar value.  In addition, I directly manage the infrastructure that makes all of the transactions happen.  I am very conscience of thinking about and ensuring the necessary steps, procedures, redundancy and personnel are in place to mitigate risk and minimize pressure.
</p>
<h2>
  Required
</h2>
<h5>
  "Experience in one or more of the following areas: system engineering, production engineering, technical process development, quality engineering, design development"
  </h5>
<p>
  I cite my design experience at Raytheon combined with my process development experience dealing with interfacing systems and data at Payday.
</p>
<h5>
  "Demonstrated proficiency in Microsoft Office products"
</h5>
<p>
  I got this! :-)
  <br></br>
  I do prefer both Google Docs and Apple Apps to MS Office, but I assure you of my proficiency.
</p>
<h2>
Desired -Familiarity with:
</h2>
<h5>
<p>
  "Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing"
</p>
<p>
  "Quality principles and processes (e.g. ISO9001, AS9100)"
</p>
</h5>
<p>
In my design engineering time at Raytheon, I referenced and worked with dimensioning and tolerancing in the CAD drawings.
</p>
<p>
  SSAE 16 is the attestation of audited processes for a service organization.  I have been involved through multiple audits and primarily responsible for a number of procedures relevant to the audit statements.  In addition, I have researched both Six Sigma approaches and Quality NM standards.
