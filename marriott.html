<p>
  I regularly perform system administration at the hardware level for the payroll and HR system hosted and replicated at Payday HCM which is named, "Evolution HCM" provided by <a href="http://www.evolutionpayroll.com/" target="_blank">evolutionpayroll.com</a>.

I manage the system administration for this platform with areas of influence ranging from cross-client reporting to data importing to user rights to printer and email distribution.  For the two cloud HRIS platforms (infinityhr.com provided by <a href="http://www.infinity-ss.com/" target="_blank">infinigy-ss.com</a> & "myHRAdmin" provided by <a href="http://www.evolutionpayroll.com/products" target="_blank">evolutionpayroll.com</a>), I adminstrate our service bureau account with the client sub-accounts inside.  The areas of influence in these two cloud platforms include:  javascripting, data import/export, API transactions, reporting, account setup and user administration.
</p>

  "Recommends and maintains security access based on roles for assigned applications"

<p>
  Given that I am a network administrator assigning rights and managing network resources and that I maintain security access and roles in the payroll and HRIS systems currently, I am ready to effectively maintain application access and prevent compromise.
</p>
<h5>
  "Programs functionality within system tools to ensure operational effectiveness."

<p>
  With my experience in SQL report writing, javascripting, python and other programming, I am confident in my ability to step in and program functionality within system tools at Marriott.
</p>

</p>
<h2>

  </h5>
<p>
  I am responsible for the SSAE 16 audit standards at Payday HCM in the IT and client account setup areas.  I regularly contribute to audit procedures and perform audit tasks.  I am more than capable to validate data accuracy and proacively clean-up data when necessary.
</p>

<p>
  "Is a team player with credibility who works with a moderate degree of independence."
</p>
<p>
  "Is results-oriented; delivers results under difficult conditions and demonstrates balanced judgment under pressure."
</p>
</h5>
<p>
  This characteristic of mine (being a team player) will best be revealed in my interactions with coworkers in onboarding and ongoing, but I do have numerous anecdotes about my approach and how teammates feel about me.  I will comment here about two things:
</p>
<p>
  I am focused on building others up, equipping them to do better.  I follow and admire <a href="http://www.givemore.com" target="_blank">Sean Parker at givemore.com</a> and <a href="http://www.startwithwhy.com" target="_blank">Simon Sinek at startwithwhy.com</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I am a manager at a payroll service bureau.  I have been here for nearly 15 years.  The company has seen profit growth each year (even during the recession beginning in 2007).  I have experienced difficult situations and a lot of pressure; payroll does seem to be "life or death" to people (it is money after all).  I can handle and excel in high-pressure environments with balanced judgement.
