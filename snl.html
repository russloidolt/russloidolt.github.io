<h2>
Highlights from Engineering Prog/Proj Lead MM (648048) primary duties:
</h2>
<h5>
"Plans and directs engineering and technical projects for internal and external customers, coordinating as required with work performed in other internal and external organizations.
Defines system and subsystem requirements, project scope, schedules, cost estimates, and deliverables that support mission objectives."
</h5>
<p>
The technical and engineering considerations of projects this position involves is certainly understated even considering the repitition of project management duties in this posting.  I admit I cannot imagine the extent of this role nor do I suggest I am completely prepared to step in and support all aspects in the beginning days.  However, I do commit to my character, my past performance and my potential.  I am a man defined by intelligence, hard work and integrity.  This foundation will be a factor in my learning and performance ongoing.  Although my previous project management efforts may not measure up to the standards necessary for SNL projects I have employed an engineering mindset and project management principles in each project I have managed.  I do commit to quickly adjusting to the necessary standards and tools.  It is my potential that still has a long runway that I am confident will help me in making adjustments.  I am committed to ongoing learning, and I have the mental bandwidth to be able to come up to speed quickly.
</p>
<h5>
"Uses engineering or technical judgment built upon a strong engineering or technical background to lead technical teams, identify potential project risks, develop risk mitigation strategies and corrective actions, and recommend risk acceptance or avoidance for all aspects of the project."
</h5>
<p>
I have a good mixture of engineering, business and customer service education and experience.  I mention this mixture because "judgement" and "lead technical teams" and "develop risk mitigation strategies" all require insight and forsight which are dependent upon depth of experience and breadth of experience.  I do not know it all, but I certainly have the mindset for and experience in contributing to the sucess of projects and minimizing poor outcomes.
</p>
<h5>
"Develops and delivers progress reports, proposals, requirements documentation, and presentations."
</h5>
<p>
In a business to business service industry, I have been involved many times in delivering proposals, communicating status updates and presenting to stakeholders and even audiences.  I enjoy crafting messages that are effective in communicating.  I also enjoy public speaking...it has been a rocky road at times, but I like to prepare presentations, practicing and speaking in front of people.

Knowledge, Skills & Abilities section:
</h2>
<h5>
"Ability to effectively prioritize and execute tasks in a high-pressure environment."
</h5>
<p>
Payroll really is not "life or death" but can seem like it at times, especially for the employees of businesses being paid.  Regardless of the validity of the perception, the pressure to meet constant deadlines and to accurately deal with transactions that combine to total millions of dollars is real.  I am part of the executive team at Payday and am ultimately responsible for and have been involved often with delivering on time sensitive transactions that have very large dollar value.  In addition, I directly manage the infrastructure that makes all of the transactions happen.  I am very conscience of thinking about and insuring the necessary steps, procedures, redundancy and personnel are in place to mitigate risk and minimize pressure.
</p>
<h2>
Desired -Familiarity with:
</h2>
<h5>
<p>
  "Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing"
</p>
<p>
  "Quality principles and processes (e.g. ISO9001, AS9100)"
</p>
</h5>
<p>
The above statement is a very good summary of my main job duties, currently. I will 'hit the ground running' with the City of Albuquerque due to my daily tasks for more than the past 5 years. I am currently responsible for a payroll services processing software that requires multiples servers and operates across different operating systems. I manage and update the Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2012 installs (currently 6 Windows servers). There are multiple services and separate programs on each of the Windows servers. The databases are housed on a Linux server. The individual client installs are for internal coworkers and cllient contacts alike. Just the core software service delivered is a significant technological responsibility, but I am also responsible for the additional network and computing infrastructure for all of the employees at Payday. I have experience navigating and troubleshooting firewalls, DNS, cabling, software settings and user actions from the source to the end user for both internal and external customers.
</p>
<h5>
"Manage customer relations and expectations"
</h5>
<p>
Payday provides ongoing customer service training. Plus, I was one of the leaders in the introduction of the Ritz-Carlton service excellence standards and basics in our culture. With the owner in 2004, I attended a two-day workshop in Atlanta at the Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center. I know that for others' success and to be successful in customer interactions, I must exemplify excellent customer service in my writing, in my phone convesations and in person.
</p>
<p>
As a core part of project management, expectations need to be noted upfront. I am confident that I will be successful with identifying expectations and delivering solutions that meets and exceeds those expectations. The City of Albuqerque will benefit from my high standard of professional interaction in all customer relations.
</p>
<h5>
"Define problems, collect data, establish facts, draw valid conclusions and prepare appropriate reports"
</h5>
<p>
I employ the tools that the owner of Payday uses from the coaching received from <a href="https://www.strategiccoach.com/home.html" target="_blank">The Strategic Coach</a>. The Strategic Coach provides coaching to entrepreneurs on thinking, tools and skills to grow their organizations. Two tools that assist in defining problems and gathering thoughts are: The Experience Transformer and The Impact Filter (two tradmarked tools by The Strategic Coach). They basically prompt discussion and documentation of facts of a given situation and facilitate the planning for improvements. I discuss this coaching and these tools as an example of my practice of gathering information for reporting on or advising for decsions. I have solid experience in progressing towards solutions by first understanding obstacles and in providing updates to stakeholders.
</p>
<h5>
"Apply a variety of computer programming languages"
</h5>
<p>
I pursue continuing education to broaden my abilities (I mentioned before about <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/harvard-colleges-computer/id263483352?mt=10" target="_blank">iTunes U</a>, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/russloidolt" target="_blank">codeacademy.com</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/617077" target="_blank">codeschool.com</a> coursework). I am currently increasing my learning about server side programming languages like Ruby and PHP. I have experience in HTML and CSS (editing the Wordpress webpages for Payday and of course creating this personal webpage in a text editor and hosted on <a href="github.com/">github.com</a>. I use javascripting to augment the functionality of a web-based HRIS system. I have written reports in SQL and modified VBA programs. I understand Linux command lines and networking console management.
