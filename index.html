        Working Together
      </h2>
      <p>
      Watching the above video gives you a visual of how I look and a sound bite of me speaking.  You can close your eyes and imagine on your own what a day would be like working with me.  Or, read on for my thoughts on how you would benefit...
      </p>
      <p>
      With me as a teammate, you would be around a person that brings high energy to the day's tasks, that is persistent in seeking and finding solutions to problems that occur, and that works at continuous improvement both in processes and abilities.  Whether I am leading a presentation in front of a group of people or I am working independently on a task, I am an energized person.  I have learned from my years of being part of sports teams that I am responsible for my own performance and that motivating myself improves my chances of winning.  Plus, life is always more fun when around fun and energized people.
      </p>
	  <p>
	  Even as a very young person, I enjoyed putting puzzles together.  Successful businesses are good at solving problems.  And, businesses that succeed are filled with people who find solutions.  I bring a solution mindset to every work day.  You would know that I could be relied on to figure things out.  If you needed financial numbers to be organized or reviewed to locate something particular, I would be able to contribute.  If you had a technical need, I would be able to troubleshoot and research likely solutions.  Reading and learning about innovations and educating myself on topics I know less than I should help me to make connections.  You would have someone to coordinate resources and organize projects.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  Continuous improvement 
	  
	  </p>
      <p>
I like to work on big challenges.  I like to win.  I like to work with talented people who are also energetic.
      </p>
      <p>
      I currently work for a great small business in New Mexico.  The central value of the owner and for the majority of us is customer service that delivers above expectations.

I work for a bigger cause/picture

      </p>
      <p>
      I am good at taking complicated, stressful situations or problems and understanding the details and simplifying...finding solutions to big problems

      <h2>
        My Backstory
      </h2>
	  <p>
	    Being able to wade through details is required in order to achieve an engineering degree.  I received my degree in mechanical engineering at Baylor University in Waco, TX.  During college, I knew I would enjoy leading people and business decisions, so I also chose to study business administration.  I added the minor in business plus a minor in mathematics to my major.  My studies in accounting and management formed a solid foundation for my career path as I later managed the books and made plans for business organizations.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    After walking the stage for my sheepskin, I chose to move away from Waco and the Design Engineer position I held in order to travel.
