</h2>
<h5>
"The coordination, specification, design, testing, implementation, and maintenance of computer-based information systems to service the Human Resources areas. The HRIS includes HR, Payroll, Time and Labor, Employment, Training, Benefits, Position Management and other related applications."
</h5>
<p>
This is in my wheel house.  As a manager in a human capital management service organization, I have been leading the setup of accounts in our software for years.  I am involved in all of the nouns used in the above statement:  coordination - I direct the project management and scheduling of resources for the work required in the software platforms used; specification - whether it is the translation of data between systems or configuring particular settings for an account, I am the go-to person for the team of personnel involved in HRIS related applications; design - basic configuration or custom javascripting, I have experience in designing functionality in software; testing - auditing the accuracy of data entry and the expected results of software functionality are both necessary areas of my focus especially given the SSAE 16 audit standards I have direct responsibility to meet; implementation - training is the result of delivering successful account setup and software functionality to the end user, and I have led hundreds of training sessions for both internal and external users; maintenance - as the Network Admin, the system maintenenance I perform goes well beyond the account configuration back into the back-end of SQL database management and server administration.<br>
My direct reports are responsible for account implementation and support of HRIS, payroll and timekeeping platforms.  HRIS has functionality within it for employment recruiting, onboarding, tracking training, managing benefit enrollment and position management.<br>
My responsbilities involve me in cross-departmental work with HR consulting personnel, benefits brokers and developing wellness programs.  I am knowledgable in all areas of the employment life cycle and human resource management:  staffing, benefits, tax credits, payroll tax management, handbooks, employee policies, retirement plans, and more.
