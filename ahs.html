      <h2>
        From the Responsibilities and Requirements:
      </h2>
      <h5>
		"Coordinates with the ERP functional teams to ensure successful and timely implementation and support of the ERP human resources and payroll modules, time & attendance, and recruiting systems."
      </h5>
	  <p>
	    My role at Payday has mainly consisted of setup and support of technology for client accounts.  Payday's service offerings span the HCM spectrum:  HR consulting, staffing, HRIS, time & labor management, payroll processing, payroll tax management, employer benefits (Payday is a broker of health, vision and dental insurance), wellness programs and retirement plans (401k and 403b plans for employers).  I have both hardware and software experience with managing and interfacing HCM systems.  I am directly involved and responsible for Payday's network infrastructure and server management.  I already do successfully coordinate with "ERP functional teams" by managing personnel, vendors and client contacts in the implementation and support of "human resources and payroll modules, time & attendance, and recruiting systems."
	  </p>
	  <h5>
	    "Coordinate with the project plan, project management, and the ERP Business Team leadership to ensure that all the ERP IT human resources, payroll, time & attendance, and recruiting systems deliverables are successfully delivered on schedule."
	  </h5>
      <p>
		I leverage and have led the adoption of Google for Work Apps.  I also use and admire <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp.com</a>.  Both of these tools have facilitated my success in collaboration on and project management of implementation projects.  I would be willing to quickly become comfortable with a more formal 'project management' software (I am an engineer after all and learn software quickly), but the simplicity of Basecamp and the Google infrastructure is the reason I use these tools with teammates and clients.  The reason I am in a leadership role at Payday is because of my history of delivering timely and successful project solutions.
      </p>
	  <h5>
	    "Coordinates with Customer Service organizations across the enterprise to ensure human resources and payroll staff are supported in a timely and complete manner.  
Coordinate with technology teams across the enterprise in deployment and support of time clocks, portals, and mobile technologies used by HCM applications and staff."
	  </h5>
      <p>
        I will apply the same skill set I continue to grow in deploying software and support to entirely separate organizations and the staff of these clients to coordinating the HCM applications across the AHS enterprise.  I am committed to high quality customer service, professional interaction and communicating status updates.  AHS staff would receive excellent customer service from me as internal clients.
      </p>
	  <h5>
	  "Requires in-depth knowledge of human resources and payroll business practices and processes, preferably in healthcare, gained by working in application support of these systems."
      </h5>
	  <p>
        My engineering education and learning ability equips me to grasp systems and subject matter even when it is complex.  My daily tasks over the last 15 years has grown my in-depth knowledge of human resources and payroll business practices and processes.  A number of our clients are in the healthcare industry, and our health insurance team activity interacts with the healthcare system (HIPPA compliance and health insurance billing, etc.); I have been exposed and involved with communication, reporting and hurdles involving the healthcare industry.
      </p>
	  <h5>
	  "Ability to anticipate potential problems, determine and implement solutions.  Outstanding critical thinking skills. Ability to analyze business needs and translate into system requirements."
	  </h5>
      <p>
        I match up with these requirements because of my mechanical education and experience combined with years of anticipating client needs in order to deliver improved solutions.  I have many anecdotes of my efforts at assessing issues and anticipating related concerns followed by implementing solutions.  Solutions have included fixes to the software or hardware configuration, reference documentation for process management, auditing data entry, additional training tailored to both the person and scenario, and deliver proposals for additional modules.
      </p>
	  <h5>
	  "Demonstrated leadership experience and ability to lead a diverse team of IT professionals.  Requires ability to work well with all levels of a complex matrix enterprise.  Requires high energy and drive, self-motivation and discipline, analytical and technical skills."
	  </h5>
      <p>
        I have managed both client account implementation and IT deployment projects.  The teams of individuals I have managed has ranged from two to more than ten.  My teams have been a group of internal direct reports working on internal processes and have included external vendors and/or client contacts.  The primary example of an long-term project with many milestones and involved more than twenty employees is my leading the conversion of all of our client accounts at the time beginning in 2004 to a different database system with different functionality and reporting.  The example I would offer regarding an IT project was when I led the deployment of our production servers in a offsite data center that involved three employees and four vendors.  It was a 6 month project that involved coordinating our VOIP support vendor, the ISP, the data center tech personnel and support staff for the database environment.  I also consistently review my project efforts in order to learn from the experience whether smooth or bumpy.

        Reading between the lines:
      </h2>
      <h5>
	    Mission, Vision & Values of Adventist Health
	  </h5>
	  <p>
	    I align with the guiding words posted on the Adventist Health webpage (About Us).  I am a go-getter; I will bring my enthusiasm to Adventist Health to reach for these stated ideals.  I lead an active life that includes spiritual fitness (my family and I are followers of Christ), regular athletic fitness and pouring into relationships (especially my family).  I make my previous statement to underline my self motivation - it takes a lot of self motivation to grow spiritually, physically and relationally!  My energetic positive attitude is the key driver in my work results.
	  </p>
	  <h5>
	    The scope of this position's responsibilities is very large and complex:  "AHS Information Services (AHS-IS) is a 600-person department of Adventist Health System," "[providing] technology systems and services for 32 of Adventist Health System’s 45 campuses," and "coordinates" so much.
	  </h5>
	  <p>
	    I am very capable of taking complex issues or situations and simplifying or understanding the components.  This posting does not intimidate me; it excites me!  I am confident that my dedication and talent will help me to be successful.  Plus, so much of my experience relates to the job posting bullets.
	  </p>
	  <h5>
	   Communication
	  </h5>
	  <p>
	    I believe that my cover letter and this webpage provides clear insight into my communication skills.  I am very detail oriented and willing to present my thoughts in any medium whether in an email or in front of a large audience. The job posting strongly implies that a lot of communication will be necessary.  I expect that most of the communication will be ongoing directions for direct reports and other involved personnel and will be status updates for management and cost tracking.  There will be plenty of instances of group presentations and email/IM interaction, too.  As I indicated in my comments about project management, I am very experienced in communicating project details in person or in writing via electronic transmission.
	  </p>
	  <h5>
	    Bridging the Technical for the Executives
	  </h5>
	  <p>
	    I interpret this position to be more of a manager than a task performer.  The reality is for a manager to be successful, one needs to have both the soft skills to lead and motivate others combined with the hands-on skills to plan effectively.  I do both in my current role.  In a smaller organization interfacing with other businesses and their staff, it is necessary for me to both accomplish hands-on project milestones as well as lead others in their contribution.  I am confident I will be effective at leading technical personnel and communicating to others, including executives at Adventist Health.  I report to the owner of Payday regularly, and I communicate with executives at client organizations.  I have interacted with Bank VP's and Presidents, mid-size business owners and various department heads.  I look forward to interacting with so many constituents at Adventist Health.
	  </p>
	  <h5>
	  Human Resources and Payroll
	  </h5>
	  <p>
	  Delivering solutions to HR and payroll personnel that directly affects the employee working has not left me unaware of the impact on day-to-day lives if there is a misstep.  As an example, I give an analogy to new hires at Payday during onboarding.  I exaggerate my title a little:  I present myself as the Chief "Seller of Happiness."  I use this phrase as an example and encouragement of what each person in the payroll business 'sells.'  I know from experience (and I believe you do to) that seeing the direct deposit of my wages in my bank account for the work I have provided makes me happy!  The alternative of not seeing that direct deposit would cause a lot of grief.  So, I know the importance of getting it right for those who receive the pay.  Managing the financial health of the business at Payday and at previous companies, I know with great clarity the importance of getting payroll right.  Errors can be very expensive to the business in a lot of ways.  I will be dedicated every day at Adventist Health to get it right.
	  </p>
	  <h5>
	  Status of the Healthcare Industry
	  </h5>
	  <p>
	  The confusion surrounding the Healthcare Industry with increased legislation and billing complexity increases as time passes.  Success for healthcare providers is dependent on smart, caring individuals being effective in their jobs.  I am certain I am barely grasping all that Adventist Health deals with to continue to successfully deliver healing, but I present myself as an "A" player to contribute to future success.  Bringing me on as part of the team will add more caring attention to detail and resourcefulness in reducing inefficiencies.  I plan on making you satisfied and happy that you chose me.
