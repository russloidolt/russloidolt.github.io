<h2>
From the Systems Analyst I I8 (#1400689) job posting:
</h2>
<h5>
"Provide responsible and complex assistance in facilitating the introduction and maintenance of management information services for City operations; perform a variety of complex systems analysis duties in the design, implementation and maintenance of management information systems and supporting computer hardware and software applications and perform a variety of technical tasks relative to assigned area of responsibility."
</h5>
<p>
My role at Payday has mainly consisted of setup and support of technology for client accounts. Payday's service offerings span the HCM spectrum: HR consulting, staffing, HRIS, time & labor management, payroll processing, payroll tax management, employer benefits (Payday is a broker of health, vision and dental insurance), wellness programs and retirement plans (401k and 403b plans for employers). I have both hardware and software experience with managing and interfacing HCM systems. I am directly involved and responsible for Payday's network infrastructure and server management. I already do successfully coordinate with "ERP functional teams" by managing personnel, vendors and client contacts in the implementation and support of "human resources and payroll modules, time & attendance, and recruiting systems."
</p>
<h5>
"Preferred Knowledge:  Theories and applications of computer science; Methods and techniques of application development, system design, programming, installation, troubleshooting and maintenance of software applications"
</h5>
<p>
I leverage and have led the adoption of Google for Work Apps. I also use and admire <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp.com</a>. Both of these tools have facilitated my success in collaboration on and project management of implementation projects. I would be willing to quickly become comfortable with a more formal 'project management' software (I am an engineer after all and learn software quickly), but the simplicity of Basecamp and the Google infrastructure is the reason I use these tools with teammates and clients. The reason I am in a leadership role at Payday is because of my history of delivering timely and successful project solutions.
