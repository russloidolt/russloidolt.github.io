<h2>
Systems Analyst I I8 (#1400689) job posting:
</h2>
<h5>
"Provide responsible and complex assistance in facilitating the introduction and maintenance of management information services for City operations; perform a variety of complex systems analysis duties in the design, implementation and maintenance of management information systems and supporting computer hardware and software applications and perform a variety of technical tasks relative to assigned area of responsibility."
</h5>
<p>
My role at Payday has consisted of setup and support of technology for client accounts. Payday's service offerings span the Human Capital Management (HCM) spectrum: HR consulting, staffing, HRIS, time & labor management, payroll processing, payroll tax management, employer benefits (Payday is a broker of health, vision and dental insurance), wellness programs and retirement plans (401k and 403b plans for employers). I have both hardware and software experience with managing and interfacing HCM systems. I am directly involved and responsible for Payday's network infrastructure and server management. I already do successfully coordinate with "ERP functional teams" by managing personnel, vendors and client contacts in the implementation and support of "human resources and payroll modules, time & attendance, and recruiting systems."
</p>
<h5>
"Preferred Knowledge:  Theories and applications of computer science; Methods and techniques of application development, system design, programming, installation, troubleshooting and maintenance of software applications"
</h5>
<p>
I bring to this role my engineering education and mindset.  In other words, I am very analytical and process-oriented.  In addition to basic computer and programming classes during my collegiate education, I have operated computers and software over the course of my working career as a power user.  I have replaced and upgraded hardware parts in workstations, laptops and servers.  My support of IT has involved many times of troubleshooting both hardware and software functionality.
<br>I also enjoy learning:
  <ul>
	<li>I am 'attending' Havard's CS50 computer science course classes that are available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/harvard-colleges-computer/id263483352?mt=10">iTunes U</a></li>
	<li>I am progressing through online learning coursework on programming at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/russloidolt">codeacadmey.com</a></li>
	<li>I am supplementing my programming learning at <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/617077">codeschool.com</a></li>
  </ul>
<br>I will be able to support the department's systems needs whether hardware or software.
</p>
<h5>
	"Basic budgeting, contracting, purchasing practices, policies and procedures"
</h5>
<p>
I am part of the executive team at Payday.  Budgeting and interacting with financials for managing company decision making occurs ongoing and particularly at quarterly management meetings.  The largest budget for which I am responsible is IT purchases.  I am equipped to handle the department's purchasing practices within the policies and procedures as well as contribute to budgeting and contracting.

Preferred Skills & Abilities section:
</h2>
<h5>
"Provide application development project management services; Utilize automated project management tools"
</h5>
<p>
I leverage and have led the adoption of Google for Work Apps. I also use and admire <a href="http://basecamp.com">Basecamp.com</a>. Both of these tools have facilitated my success in collaboration on and project management of implementation projects. I have used more formal 'project management' software in the past and would be able to quickly come up to speed on the project management platform used by the department (I am an engineer after all and learn software quickly), but the simplicity of Basecamp and the Google infrastructure is the reason I use these tools with teammates and clients. The reason I am in a leadership role at Payday is because of my history of delivering timely and successful project solutions.
</p>
<h5>
"Recommend, design, implement, install and maintain computer software applications; Analyze and assess the technological needs of City departments"
</h5>
<p>
The above statement is a very good summary of my main job duties, currently.  I will 'hit the ground running' with the City of Albuquerque due to my daily tasks for more than the past 5 years.  I am currently responsible for a payroll services processing software that requires multiples servers and operates across different operating systems.  I manage and update the Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2012 installs.  There are multiple services and separate programs on each of the Windows servers.  The databases are housed on a Linux server.  The individual client installs are for internal coworkers and cllient contacts alike.  Just the core software service delivered is a significant technological responsibility, but I am also responsible for the additional network and computing infrastructure for all of the employees at Payday.  I have experience navigating and troubleshooting firewalls, DNS, cabling, software settings and user actions from the source to the end user for both internal and external customers.
</p>
<h5>
"Manage customer relations and expectations"
</h5>
<p>
	
</p>
<h5>
"Define problems, collect data, establish facts, draw valid conclusions and prepare appropriate reports"
</h5>
<p>
	
</p>
<h5>
"Apply a variety of computer programming languages"
</h5>
<p>
I pursue continuing education to broaden my abilities (I mentioned before about <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/harvard-colleges-computer/id263483352?mt=10">iTunes U</a>, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/russloidolt">codeacademy.com</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/617077">codeschool.com</a> coursework).  I am currently increasing my learning about server side programming languages like Ruby and PHP.  I have experience in HTML and CSS (editing the Wordpress webpages for Payday and of course creating this personal webpage in a text editor and hosted on <a href="github.com/">github.com</a>.  I use javascripting to augment the functionality of a web-based HRIS system.  I have written reports in SQL and modified VBA programs.  I understand Linux command lines and networking console management.
