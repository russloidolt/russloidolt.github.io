<h2>
Systems Analyst I I8 (#1400689) job posting:
</h2>
<h5>
"Provide responsible and complex assistance in facilitating the introduction and maintenance of management information services for City operations; perform a variety of complex systems analysis duties in the design, implementation and maintenance of management information systems and supporting computer hardware and software applications and perform a variety of technical tasks relative to assigned area of responsibility."
</h5>
<p>
My role at Payday has consisted of setup and support of technology for client accounts. Payday's service offerings span the Human Capital Management (HCM) spectrum: HR consulting, staffing, HRIS, time & labor management, payroll processing, payroll tax management, employer benefits (Payday is a broker of health, vision and dental insurance), wellness programs and retirement plans (401k and 403b plans for employers). I have both hardware and software experience with managing and interfacing HCM systems. I am directly involved and responsible for Payday's network infrastructure and server management. I already do successfully coordinate with "ERP functional teams" by managing personnel, vendors and client contacts in the implementation and support of "human resources and payroll modules, time & attendance, and recruiting systems."
</p>
<p>

</p>
<h5>
"Preferred Knowledge:  Theories and applications of computer science; Methods and techniques of application development, system design, programming, installation, troubleshooting and maintenance of software applications"
</h5>
<p>
I bring to this role my engineering education and mindset.  In other words, I am very analytical and process-oriented.  In addition to basic computer and programming classes during my collegiate education, I have operated computers and software over the course of my working career as a power user.  I have replaced and upgraded hardware parts in workstations, laptops and servers.  My support of IT has involved many times of troubleshooting both hardware and software functionality.
<br>I also enjoy learning:
  <ul>
	<li>I am 'attending' Havard's CS50 computer science course classes that are available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/harvard-colleges-computer/id263483352?mt=10" target="_blank">iTunes U</a></li>
	<li>I am progressing through online learning coursework on programming at <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/russloidolt" target="_blank">codeacadmey.com</a></li>
	<li>I am supplementing my programming learning at <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/617077" target="_blank">codeschool.com</a></li>
  </ul>
<br>I will be able to support the department's systems needs whether hardware or software.
</p>
<h5>
	"Basic budgeting, contracting, purchasing practices, policies and procedures"
</h5>
<p>
I am part of the executive team at Payday.  Budgeting and interacting with financials for managing company decision making occurs ongoing and particularly at quarterly management meetings.  The largest budget for which I am responsible is IT purchases.  I am equipped to handle the department's purchasing practices within the policies and procedures as well as contribute to budgeting and contracting.
</p>
The network infrastructure I maintain has a significant amount of complexity for a small business of about 50 employees, but we essentially are a software provider to thousands of users.  Production servers are in cabinets at a local tier III data center.  Network services and data are replicated from our offices to the data center.  Client databases are replicated from the data center to our office as well as to an encrypted cloud backup service.  Secure remote access is available to certain remote workers.  There are two satelite offices in El Paso and Phoenix.  I am the administrator for our Google Apps (cloud exchange) and our Linode web servers.  In addition to applying the frequent Windows updates to the servers, I also apply the payroll processing software updates and desktop client updates when I am involved in desktop support.  I am providing this brief summary to illustrate my experience in navigating technology and computing complexity.  I will be able to provide the assistance necessary in a responsible manner and even dealing with complexity in supporting the information services for the City operations.

Preferred Skills & Abilities section:
</h2>
<h5>
"Provide application development project management services; Utilize automated project management tools"
</h5>
<p>
I leverage and have led the adoption of Google for Work Apps. I also use and admire <a href="http://basecamp.com" target="_blank">Basecamp.com</a>. Both of these tools have facilitated my success in collaboration on and project management of implementation projects. I have used more formal 'project management' software in the past and would be able to quickly come up to speed on the project management platform used by the department (I am an engineer after all and learn software quickly), but the simplicity of Basecamp and the Google infrastructure is the reason I use these tools with teammates and clients. The reason I am in a leadership role at Payday is because of my history of delivering timely and successful project solutions.
</p>
<h5>
"Recommend, design, implement, install and maintain computer software applications; Analyze and assess the technological needs of City departments"
</h5>
<p>
The above statement is a very good summary of my main job duties, currently.  I will 'hit the ground running' with the City of Albuquerque due to my daily tasks for more than the past 5 years.  I am currently responsible for a payroll services processing software that requires multiples servers and operates across different operating systems.  I manage and update the Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2012 installs (currently 6 Windows servers).  There are multiple services and separate programs on each of the Windows servers.  The databases are housed on a Linux server.  The individual client installs are for internal coworkers and cllient contacts alike.  Just the core software service delivered is a significant technological responsibility, but I am also responsible for the additional network and computing infrastructure for all of the employees at Payday.  I have experience navigating and troubleshooting firewalls, DNS, cabling, software settings and user actions from the source to the end user for both internal and external customers.
</p>
<h5>
"Manage customer relations and expectations"
</h5>
<p>
Payday provides ongoing customer service training.  Plus, I was one of the leaders in the introduction of the Ritz-Carlton service excellence standards and basics in our culture.  With the owner in 2004, I attended a two-day workshop in Atlanta at the Ritz-Carlton Leadership Center.  I know that for others' success and to be successful in customer interactions, I must exemplify excellent customer service in my writing, in my phone convesations and in person.
</p>
<p>
As a core part of project management, expectations need to be noted upfront.  I am confident that I will be successful with identifying expectations and delivering solutions that meets and exceeds those expectations.  The City of Albuqerque will benefit from my high standard of professional interaction in all customer relations.
</p>
<h5>
"Define problems, collect data, establish facts, draw valid conclusions and prepare appropriate reports"
</h5>
<p>
I employ the tools that the owner of Payday uses from the coaching received from <a href="https://www.strategiccoach.com/home.html" target="_blank">The Strategic Coach</a>.  The Strategic Coach provides coaching to entrepreneurs on thinking, tools and skills to grow their organizations.  Two tools that assist in defining problems and gathering thoughts are: The Experience Transformer and The Impact Filter (two tradmarked tools by The Strategic Coach).  They basically prompt discussion and documentation of facts of a given situation and facilitate the planning for improvements.  I discuss this coaching and these tools as an example of my practice of gathering information for reporting on or advising for decsions.  I have solid experience in progressing towards solutions by first understanding obstacles and in providing updates to stakeholders.
</p>
<h5>
"Apply a variety of computer programming languages"
</h5>
<p>
I pursue continuing education to broaden my abilities (I mentioned before about <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/harvard-colleges-computer/id263483352?mt=10" target="_blank">iTunes U</a>, <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/russloidolt" target="_blank">codeacademy.com</a> and <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/users/617077" target="_blank">codeschool.com</a> coursework).  I am currently increasing my learning about server side programming languages like Ruby and PHP.  I have experience in HTML and CSS (editing the Wordpress webpages for Payday and of course creating this personal webpage in a text editor and hosted on <a href="github.com/">github.com</a>.  I use javascripting to augment the functionality of a web-based HRIS system.  I have written reports in SQL and modified VBA programs.  I understand Linux command lines and networking console management.
